[SmartGardener](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki) is a software to create, setup and run Ciber Green Voltaics plant walls. 

Overview
============
Developing time has been divided in 4 big [milestones](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/milestones):

- A planification sprint over demarcation of concept space called [Playground](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Playground).
- A sprint over fenomenologic component called [Holon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Holon).
- A sprint over noumenologic component called [Informon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Informon).
- A sprint to showcase SmartGardener apps release: a) [SmartGardener-holon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/holon-SmartGardener) and [SmartGardener-informon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/informon-SmartGardener).

Using guidelines
============

- Open the SmartGardener v 0.1, locate **menu / new / Create a playground**. Link a geolocation, define dimensions, pick plant. Launch it. An **empty environment** is showed linked to general access **weather forecasting and climatic regions** big data sources. **Circadian and seasonal timers** are triggered on a runtime line.
- Release [SmartGardener Landing Page](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-landing).

- Locate in playground desk the **"Launch holon" button**. Launch it. Defined wall appears inside previous environment with its own runtime line. [**Per plant type models**](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-models) are loaded into plot holders linked to **SmartCitizen sensors platform**.
- Monitor the onboarding cycle. Calibration process. Release [SmartGardener OnBoard Wizard](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-onboarding-app-start).
- Stabilize plots and monitor lifetime. Release [SmartGardener Plot Dashboard](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-react-dashboard)
- Stabilize wall and monitor lifetime. Release [SmartGardener Wall Dashboard](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-now-dashboard).

- Locate in holon desk the **"Launch informon" button**. Launch it. Existing environment and wall are presented into augmented reality scenario linking together modeled wall lifetime and real time wall.
-- Monitor the onboarding cycle. Calibration process. Release [SmartGardener Kit HyperPlatform](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-web).
-- Stabilize wall brain [docs](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-docs/tree/master/docs/Sensor%20Analysis%20Framework) and monitor lifetime.  Release [SmartGardener Brain Framework](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-data). Release [SmartGardener ONNX Agent Builder](https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxjs).
