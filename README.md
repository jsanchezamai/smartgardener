[SmartGardener](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki) is a software to create, setup and run Ciber Green Voltaics plant walls. 

Overview
============
Developing time has been divided in 4 big [milestones](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/milestones):

- A planification sprint over demarcation of concept space called [Playground](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Playground).
- A sprint over fenomenologic component called [Holon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Holon).
- A sprint over noumenologic component called [Informon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Informon).
- A sprint to showcase SmartGardener apps release: a) [SmartGardener-holon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/holon-SmartGardener) and [SmartGardener-informon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/informon-SmartGardener).

Using guidelines
============

- Create a playground for your wall. Link a geolocation, define dimensions, pick plant. Launch it. An empty environment is showed linked to general access weather forecasting and climatic regions big data sources. Circadian and seasonal timers are triggered on a runtime line.

- Locate in playground desk the "Launch holon" button. Launch it. Defined wall appears inside previous environment inside with its own runtime line. Per plant type models are loaded into plot holders linked to SmartCitizen sensors platform.
-- Monitor the onboarding cycle. Calibration process.
-- Stabilize wall and monitor lifetime

- Locate in holon desk the "Launch informon" button. Launch it. Existing environment and wall are presented into augmented reality scenario linking together modeled wall lifetime and real time wall.
-- Monitor the onboarding cycle. Calibration process.
-- Stabilize wall brain and monitor lifetime.

Get and run
