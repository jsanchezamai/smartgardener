- Application context, [Playground](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Playground).
- Wall definition, [Holon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Holon).
- Lifetime experience [Informon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/Informon).
- SmartGardener Release: [SmartGardener-holon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/holon-SmartGardener) and [SmartGardener-informon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/informon-SmartGardener).

[SmartGardener-informon](https://github.com/jsanchezamai/smartgardener/wiki/informon-SmartGardener)
-------------------

User should be able to:

- Locate in holon desk the **"Launch informon" button**. Launch it. Existing environment and wall are presented into augmented reality scenario linking together modeled wall lifetime and real time wall.

This milestone should release:
- Monitor the onboarding cycle. Calibration process. Release [SmartGardener Kit HyperPlatform](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-web).
- Stabilize wall brain [docs](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-docs/tree/master/docs/Sensor%20Analysis%20Framework) and monitor lifetime.
